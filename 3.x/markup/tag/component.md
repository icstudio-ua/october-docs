# {% component %}

The `{% component %}` tag will parse the default markup content for a [CMS component](../../cms/themes/components.md) and display it on the page. Not all components provide default markup, the documentation for the plugin will guide in the correct usage.

```twig
{% component "blogPosts" %}
```

This will render the component partial with a fixed name of **default.htm** and is essentially an alias for the following:

```twig
{% partial "blogPosts::default" %}
```

## Variables

Some components support passing variables to them at render time.

```twig
{% component "blogPosts" postsPerPage="5" %}
```

## Customizing Components

In most cases the `{% component %}` tag is not needed and the markup is provided as a usage example for the component API. Components are intended to be customized, this can be done in two ways:

1. Moving the default markup to a partial
1. Overriding component partials using the theme

The [CMS Components article](../../cms/themes/components.md) outlines the process of customizing default markup.
