# {% styles %}

The `{% styles %}` tag renders CSS links to stylesheet files injected by the application. The tag is commonly defined in the HEAD section of a page or layout:

```twig
<head>
    ...
    {% styles %}
</head>
```

> **Note**: This tag should appear once only in a given page cycle to prevent duplicated references.

## Injecting styles

Links to StyleSheet files can be programmatically injected in PHP either by [components](../../extend/cms-components.md) or [pages](../../cms/themes/pages.md).

```php
function onStart()
{
    $this->addCss('assets/css/hello.css');
}
```

You can also inject raw markup to the `{% styles %}` tag by using the **styles** anonymous placeholder [in the layout](../../cms/themes/layouts.md). Use the `{% put %}` tag in pages or layouts to add content to the placeholder.

```twig
{% put styles %}
    <link href="/themes/demo/assets/css/page.css" rel="stylesheet" />
{% endput %}
```
