subtitle: A simple AJAX framework that ships with October CMS.
---
# Introduction

October CMS includes a framework that brings a full suite of AJAX capabilities which allow you to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. The same library can be used in CMS themes and anywhere in the backend panel.

The AJAX framework comes in two flavors, you may either use [the JavaScript API](./javascript-api.md) or [the data attributes API](./attributes-api.md). The data attributes API doesn't require any JavaScript knowledge to use AJAX with October CMS.

## Including the Framework

::: aside
The AJAX framework is optional in your CMS theme and you can always include your preferred framework instead.
:::

When working with your [CMS theme](../../cms/themes/themes.md), using the library is as simple as including it with a Twig tag. Place the `{% framework %}` tag anywhere inside your page or layout. This adds a reference to the October CMS frontend JavaScript library, for example.

```twig
{% framework %}
```

The `{% framework %}` tag supports the optional **extras** and **turbo** parameters. If these parameter are specified, the tag adds StyleSheet and JavaScript files for [extra features](./extras.md), including form validation, loading indicators and [turbo-charged routing](./turbo-router.md).

```twig
{% framework extras turbo %}
```

## How AJAX Requests Work

A page can issue an AJAX request either prompted by data attributes or by using JavaScript. Each request invokes an **event handler** -- also called an [AJAX handler](./handlers.md) -- on the server and can update page elements using partials. AJAX requests work best with forms, since the form data is automatically sent to the server. Here is request workflow:

1. The client browser issues an AJAX request by providing the handler name and other optional parameters.
2. The server finds the [AJAX handler](./handlers.md) and executes it.
3. The handler executes the required business logic and updates the environment by injecting page variables.
4. The server [renders partials](./update-partials.md) requested by the client with the `update` option.
5. The server sends the response, containing the rendered partials markup.
6. The client-side framework updates page elements with the partials data received from the server.

## Usage Example

Below is a simple example that uses the data attributes API to define an AJAX enabled form. The form will issue an AJAX request to the **onTest** handler and requests that the result container be updated with the **mypartial** partial markup.

::: tip
The form data for `value1` and `value2` are automatically sent with the AJAX request.

```html
<!-- AJAX enabled form -->
<form data-request="onTest" data-request-update="mypartial: '#myDiv'">

    <!-- Input two values -->
    <input name="value1"> + <input name="value2">

    <!-- Action button -->
    <button type="submit">Calculate</button>

</form>

<!-- Result container -->
<div id="myDiv"></div>
```
:::

The **mypartial** partial contains markup that reads the `result` variable.

```twig
The result is {{ result }}
```

The **onTest** handler method accessed the form data using the `input` [helper method](../../extend/services/helpers.md) and the result is passed to the `result` page variable.

```php
function onTest()
{
    $this->page['result'] = input('value1') + input('value2');
}
```

The example could be read like this: "When the form is submitted, issue an AJAX request to the **onTest** handler. When the handler finishes, render the **mypartial** partial and inject its contents to the **#myDiv** element."
