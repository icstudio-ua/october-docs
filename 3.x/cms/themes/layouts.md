# Layouts

Layouts define a common scaffold for your pages, which usually means everything that repeats on every page, such as a header and a footer. They will almost always contain HTML code such as HEAD, TITLE and BODY tags.

Layout template files reside in the **layouts** directory in your theme. Layout template files should have the **htm** extension. Inside the layout file you should use the `{% page %}` tag to output the page content. Next is an example of the simplest possible layout.

```twig
<html>
    <body>
        {% page %}
    </body>
</html>
```

::: aside
Remember that if you refer a layout from a subdirectory you should specify the subdirectory name.

To use a layout for a [page](./pages.md), the page should refer the layout file name (without extension) in the configuration section. Below is an example page template using the **default.htm** layout.

```twig
url = "/"
layout = "default"
==
<p>Hello, world!</p>
```

When this page is requested its content is merged with the layout, or more precisely - the layout's `{% page %}` tag is replaced with the page content. The previous examples would generate the following markup:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

Note that you can [render partials](./partials.md) in layouts. This lets you to share the common markup elements between different layouts. For example, you can have a partial that outputs the website CSS and JavaScript links. This approach simplifies the resource management - if you want to add a JavaScript reference you should modify a single partial instead of editing all the layouts.

The configuration section is optional for layouts. The supported configuration parameters are **name** and **description**. The parameters are optional and used in the back-end user interface. Example layout template with a description:

```twig
description = "Basic layout example"
==
<html>
    <body>
        {% page %}
    </body>
</html>
```

## Using a Dynamic Page Title

The `meta_title` and `meta_description` properties of a [page](pages.md) support parsing variables from the page lifecycle. The following layout template will set the page title based on the value of the active page.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{ this.page.meta_title }} - October CMS</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {% page %}
    </body>
<html>
```

The page template can then define its title using Twig-like variable syntax using values that are available in the global environment, in this case the **post.title** value is used.

```ini
url = "/blog"
meta_title = "{{ post.title }} - Blog"
```

> **Note**: Only basic Twig variables are supported. Filters, tags and functions cannot be used.

## Placeholders

Placeholders allow pages to inject content to the layout. Placeholders are defined in the layout templates with the `{% placeholder %}` tag. The next example shows a layout template with a placeholder **head** defined in the HTML HEAD section.

```twig
<html>
    <head>
        {% placeholder head %}
    </head>
    ...
</html>
```

Pages can inject content to placeholders with the `{% put %}` and `{% endput %}` tags. The following example demonstrates a simple page template which injects a CSS link to the placeholder **head** defined in the previous example.

```
url = "/my-page"
layout = "default"
==
{% put head %}
    <link href="/themes/demo/assets/css/page.css" rel="stylesheet">
{% endput %}

<p>The page content goes here.</p>
```

More information on placeholders can be found [in the Markup guide](../markup/tag-placeholder.md).

## Dynamic Layouts

Layouts, like pages, can use any Twig features. Please refer to the [Dynamic Pages section](pages.md) of the documentation for details.

### Layout Execution Life Cycle

Inside the layout's PHP section you can define the following functions for handling the page execution life cycle: `onInit`, `onStart`, `onBeforePageStart` and `onEnd`.

The `onInit` function is executed when all components are initialized and before AJAX requests are handled. The `onStart` function is executed in the beginning of the page processing. The `onBeforePageStart` function is executed after the layout [components](components.md) ran, but before the page's `onStart` function is executed. The `onEnd` function is executed after the page is rendered. The sequence the handlers are executed is following:

1. Layout `onInit()` function.
1. Page `onInit()` function.
1. Layout `onStart()` function.
1. Layout components `onRun()` method.
1. Layout `onBeforePageStart()` function.
1. Page `onStart()` function.
1. Page components `onRun()` method.
1. Page `onEnd()` function.
1. Layout `onEnd()` function.
