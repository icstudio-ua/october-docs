# Password

The `password` field renders a single line password field and is used for capturing sensitive values, like passwords.

```yaml
user_password:
    label: Password
    type: password
```

::: tip
Take a look at the [Sensitive form widget](./widget-sensitive.md) for a field that can capture and display sensitive values.
