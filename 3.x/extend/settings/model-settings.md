# Model Settings

## Database Settings

Plugins can use database-driven configuration using models for storing settings in the database by implementing the `SettingsModel` behavior in a model class. This model can be used directly for creating the backend settings form. You don't need to create a database table and a controller for creating the backend settings forms based on the settings model.

The settings model classes should extend the Model class and implement the `System\Behaviors\SettingsModel` behavior. The settings models, like any other models, should be defined in the **models** subdirectory of the plugin directory. The model from the next example should be defined in the `plugins/acme/demo/models/UserSetting.php` file.

```php
namespace Acme\Demo\Models;

use Model;

class UserSetting extends Model
{
    /**
     * @var array implement these behaviors
     */
    public $implement = [
        \System\Behaviors\SettingsModel::class
    ];

    /**
     * @var string settingsCode unique to this model
     */
    public $settingsCode = 'acme_demo_settings';

    /**
     * @var string settingsFields configuration
     */
    public $settingsFields = 'fields.yaml';
}
```

The `$settingsCode` property is required for settings models. It defines the unique settings key which is used for saving the settings to the database.

The `$settingsFields` property is required if you are going to build a backend settings form based on the model. The property specifies a name of the YAML file containing the form fields definition. The form fields are described in the [form controller article](../forms/form-controller.md). The YAML file should be placed to the directory with the name matching the model class name in lowercase. For the model from the previous example the directory structure would look like this:

::: dir
├── plugins
|   └── acme
|       └── demo
|           ├── models
|           |   ├── usersetting  _← Config Directory_
|           |   |   └── fields.yaml  _← Form Fields_
|           |   └── `UserSetting.php`  _← Model Class_
|           └── Plugin.php
:::

Settings models can be registered to appear on the [settings area in the backend panel](./settings.md), but it is not a requirement - you can set and read settings values like any other model.

## Writing to a Settings Model

The settings model has the static `set` method that allows to save individual or multiple values. You can also use the standard model features for setting the model properties and saving the model.

```php
use Acme\Demo\Models\UserSetting;

// Set a single value
UserSetting::set('api_key', 'ABCD');

// Set an array of values
UserSetting::set(['api_key' => 'ABCD']);

// Set object values
$settings = UserSetting::instance();
$settings->api_key = 'ABCD';
$settings->save();
```

## Reading From a Settings Model

The settings model has the static `get` method that enables you to load individual properties. Also, when you instantiate a model with the `instance` method, it loads the properties from the database and you can access them directly.

```php
// Outputs: ABCD
echo UserSetting::instance()->api_key;

// Get a single value
echo UserSetting::get('api_key');

// Get a value and return a default value if it doesn't exist
echo UserSetting::get('is_activated', true);
```
