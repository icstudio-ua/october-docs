# Web Server Configuration

## Security & Performance

### Public Folder

In the default configuration, the entire October CMS root directory is open for web access. For ultimate security in production environments, you may configure the web server to use a public folder to ensure only files in specific directories can be accessed.

First you will need to spawn a public folder using the `october:mirror` command:

```bash
php artisan october:mirror
```

It will create a new directory called `public` in the project's root directory. Inside the directory, the command creates symbolic links to assets and resources directories for all plugins, modules and themes existing in the project.

::: tip
In Apache, the server and virtual host document location is managed with the `DocumentRoot` directive.
:::

The web server configuration must be updated to point to the public directory instead of the project's root directory.

::: aside
In Windows operating systems, the `october:mirror` command can only be executed in a console running as administrator.
:::

The `october:mirror` command should be performed after each system update or when a new plugin is installed. You may instruct October CMS to run the command each time after updating the project with the Composer. The auto mirroring feature is managed with the `system.auto_mirror_public` configuration parameter.

### Improving Performance

This section describes steps that increase the application performance and is recommended for all production environments since it will drastically improve the page load time.

In the configuration, disable [debug mode](../setup/configuration.html#debug-mode) and enable the caching layers. For example, if you are using the `.env` file:

```ini
APP_DEBUG=false
CMS_ROUTE_CACHE=true
CMS_ASSET_CACHE=true
CMS_TWIG_CACHE=true
```

In the console, cache the system structure with these commands:

```bash
php artisan october:optimize

composer dump-autoload --optimize
```

### Shared Hosting Security

In shared hosting environments, extra steps must be done to protect your project files from other users that share the server with you.

::: warning
Consult with your hosting provider for suitable permission masks. The general rule is that the application files must not be accessible by other users. All files must be accessible and manageable by the owner user and the web server. Configuration files must be accessible by the owner user and web server, but the web server must not be able to change them.
:::

October CMS can automatically set permissions for new files and directories. The default permissions are managed with the `system.default_mask.file` and `system.default_mask.folder` configuration parameters. For example, if you are using the `.env` file to declare the environment variables:

```ini
DEFAULT_FILE_MASK=644
DEFAULT_FOLDER_MASK=755
```

## Server-specific Configuration

This section describes the configuration for various web servers.

::: details Apache
To run October CMS applications, the Apache server must have the following configuration:

* the [mod_rewrite module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html) must be installed
* the [AllowOverride directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#AllowOverride) for the application directory must have the `All` value.

In some cases you may need to uncomment the [RewriteBase directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritebase) in the project’s `.htaccess` file:

```text
# RewriteBase /
```

If you have installed October CMS to a subdirectory, add its name to the directive value. In this way, you can have URLs like example.com/subdirectory/page.

```text
# RewriteBase /subdirectory/
```
:::

::: details Nginx
Use the following code in the server section of the Nginx site configuration. If you have installed October CMS into a subdirectory, replace the first `/` in location directives with the subdirectory name.

```text
location / {
    # Let October CMS handle everything by default.
    # The path not resolved by October CMS router will return October CMS's 404 page.
    # Everything that does not match with the allowlist below will fall into this.
    rewrite ^/.*$ /index.php last;
}

# Pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server
location ~ ^/index.php {
    # Write your FPM configuration here

}

# Allowlist
location ~ ^/favicon\.ico { try_files $uri /index.php; }
location ~ ^/sitemap\.xml { try_files $uri /index.php; }
location ~ ^/robots\.txt { try_files $uri /index.php; }
location ~ ^/humans\.txt { try_files $uri /index.php; }

# Block all .dotfiles except well-known
location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* { deny all; }

## Let nginx return 404 if static file not exists
location ~ ^/storage/app/uploads/public { try_files $uri 404; }
location ~ ^/storage/app/media { try_files $uri 404; }
location ~ ^/storage/app/resources { try_files $uri 404; }

location ~ ^/themes/.*/resources { try_files $uri 404; }
```

::: details Lighttpd
Paste the following code in the Lighttpd sites configuration file and change the `host address` and `server.document-root` to match your project’s location.

```text
$HTTP["host"] =~ "domain.example.com" {
    server.document-root = "/var/www/example/"

    url.rewrite-once = (
        "^/(plugins|modules/(system|backend|cms))/(([\w-]+/)+|/|)assets/([\w-]+/)+[-\w^&'@{}[\],$=!#().%+~/ ]+\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|swf|avi|mpg|mpeg|mp3|flv|ico|css|js|woff|ttf)(\?.*|)$" => "$0",
        "^/(system|themes/[\w-]+)/assets/([\w-]+/)+[-\w^&'@{}[\],$=!#().%+~/ ]+\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|swf|avi|mpg|mpeg|mp3|flv|ico|css|js|woff|ttf)(\?.*|)$" => "$0",

        "^/(favicon\.ico)$" => "$0",
        "(.*)" => "/index.php$1"
    )
