# Errors & Logging

When you first start using October CMS, error and exception handling is already configured for you. There are two ways the event log can be accessed:

1. The event log can be viewed in the file system by opening the file `storage/logs/system.log`.
1. Alternatively it can be viewed via the backend panel by navigating to **Settings â†’ Event Log**.

Log entries are always created when an error page is shown and for certain [exception types](../extend/system/exceptions.md).

## Configuration

#### Error Detail

The amount of error detail your application displays through the browser is controlled by the `debug` configuration option in your `config/app.php` configuration file. By default detailed error reporting is turned *on* so it is helpful to see detailed error information which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues. When this feature is turned off, when there is a problem in a page, a generic error message will be displayed.

For local development, you should set the `debug` value to `true`. In your production environment, this value should always be `false`.

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Application Debug Mode
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| When your application is in debug mode, detailed error messages with
| stack traces will be shown on every error that occurs within your
| application. If disabled, a simple generic error page is shown.
|
*/

'debug' => false,
```

#### Log File Modes

October CMS supports various drivers, including `single`, `daily`, `syslog` and `errorlog` logging modes. For example, if you wish to use daily log files instead of a single file, you should simply set the `default` value in your `config/logging.php` configuration file:

```php
'default' => env('LOG_CHANNEL', 'daily'),
```
