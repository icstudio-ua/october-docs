# Common Configuration

All of the configuration files for October CMS are stored in the `config` directory. Each configuration parameter has inline documentation.

## Environment Configuration

Many of October CMS parameters can be configured using environment variables. Environment variables can be set on the server level, or defined for the [web application's virtual host](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/env.html).

::: aside
October CMS uses the [DotEnv library](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) to make it easy to manage environment variables.
:::

Environment variables can also be defined in the `.env` file that the installation script automatically creates in the project root directory. In a fresh installation of October CMS, the base directory contains a `.env.example` file that provides typical values for a local environment.

For example, the database connection can be specified with these variables:

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=database
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Any variable in the `.env` file can be overridden by external environment variables defined on the server or virtual host level.

Configuration values are loaded in this order:

1. system environment variables
2. variables in the .env file
3. values in the configuration PHP files.

::: warning
Never add the `.env` file to source control. It would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to the repository.

### Environment-Specific Configuration Files

If a configuration file must be loaded based on the current application environment, e.g. staging or production, you can use the server-level `APP_ENV` variable. Example Apache configuration:

```text
SetEnv APP_ENV "staging"
```

When the `APP_ENV` variable is defined, the platform attempts to load a .env file with the suffix matching the environment name. e.g. `.env.staging`. If the file does not exist, there will be no error. If both `.env.staging` and `.env` files exist, the `.env` file is completely ignored.

## Common Configuration Parameters

There are several important commonly used configuration parameters.

### Debug Mode

The `debug` parameter can be found in the `config/app.php` file. By default, the value is loaded from the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable. After the installation, the debug mode is enabled in the `.env` file:

```ini
APP_DEBUG=true
```

When enabled, the debug mode shows detailed error messages when they occur, along with other debugging features. While useful during development, the debug mode must be disabled on a live production site. It prevents potentially sensitive information from being displayed to website visitors.

Features provided by the debug mode:

* [detailed error messages](../cms/pages.md#error-page)
* failed user authentication provides a specific reason
* [combined assets](../markup/filter-theme.md) are not minified by default
* [safe mode](../setup/configuration.md#safe-mode) is disabled by default.

### Safe Mode

The `enable_safe_mode` parameter can be found in the `config/cms.php` file. By default, the value is loaded from the `CMS_SAFE_MODE` environment variable. Safe mode disables the [PHP code section](../cms/themes.md#php-code-section) in CMS templates.

The parameter can take one of the following values:

* `true` - safe mode is enabled
* `false` - safe mode is disabled
* `null` - safe mode is active if [debug mode](../setup/configuration.md#debug-mode) is disabled.

### CSRF protection

October CMS provides a built-in [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) prevention mechanism. When CSRF protection is enabled, October CMS stores a random token in the user's session. The [form opening tag](../services/html.md#opening-a-form) and the [form token tag](../services/html.md#form-tokens) add a hidden field with the token value to the form. For all POST, PUT or DELETE requests, the platform checks whether the submitted token value matches the one stored in the user session.

CSRF protection is enabled by default. The `enable_csrf_protection` parameter can be found in the `config/system.php` file. By default, the value is loaded from the `ENABLE_CSRF` environment variable.

## Production Configuration

The following configuration is recommended for production environments:

* CSRF protection is enabled
* debug mode is disabled
* use the [public folder](../setup/web-server-config.md#public-folder) for additional security.
