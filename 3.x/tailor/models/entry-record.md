## PHP Interface

To look up an entry using PHP, you may use the `inSection` static method and pass the handle to return a prepared database query.

```php
// Return all entries by the handle
Tailor\Models\EntryRecord::inSection('Blog\Posts')->get();
```

Alternatively, you can look it up using the UUID and the `inSectionUuid` method.

```php
// Return all entries by the UUID
Tailor\Models\EntryRecord::inSectionUuid('a63fabaf-7c0b-4c74-b36f-7abf1a3ad1c1')->get();
```

If an entry type is a `single`, you can use the `findSingleForSection` method to look up the entry.

```php
// Return a single entry by the handle
Tailor\Models\EntryRecord::findSingleForSection('Homepage');
```

Likewise, the `findSingleForSectionUuid` can be used for looking up by the UUID.

```php
// Return a single entry by the UUID
Tailor\Models\EntryRecord::findSingleForSectionUuid('3328c303-7989-462e-b866-27e7037ba275');
```
