# Forms

**Form Behavior** is a controller modifier used for easily adding form functionality to a back-end page. The behavior provides three pages called Create, Update and Preview. The Preview page is a read-only version of the Update page. When you use the form behavior you don't need to define the `create`, `update` and `preview` actions in the controller - the behavior does it for you. However you should provide the corresponding view files.

Form behavior depends on form [field definitions](#oc-defining-form-fields) and a [model class](../database/model.md). In order to use the form behavior you should add it to the `$implement` property of the controller class. Also, the `$formConfig` class property should be defined and its value should refer to the YAML file used for configuring the behavior options.

```php
namespace Acme\Blog\Controllers;

class Categories extends \Backend\Classes\Controller
{
    public $implement = [
        \Backend\Behaviors\FormController::class
    ];

    public $formConfig = 'config_form.yaml';
}
```

> **Note**: Very often the form and [list behavior](../backend/lists.md) are used together in a same controller.

## Configuring the Form Behavior

The configuration file referred in the `$formConfig` property is defined in YAML format. The file should be placed into the controller's [views directory](controllers-ajax.md). Below is an example of a typical form behavior configuration file.

```yaml
# ===================================
#  Form Behavior Config
# ===================================

name: Blog Category
form: $/acme/blog/models/post/fields.yaml
modelClass: Acme\Blog\Post

create:
    title: New Blog Post

update:
    title: Edit Blog Post

preview:
    title: View Blog Post
```

The following fields are required in the form configuration file.

Field | Description
------------- | -------------
**name** | the name of the object being managed by this form.
**form** | a configuration array or reference to a form field definition file, see [form fields](#oc-defining-form-fields).
**modelClass** | a model class name, the form data is loaded and saved against this model.

The configuration options listed below are optional. Define them if you want the form behavior to support the [Create](#oc-create-page), [Update](#oc-update-page) or [Preview](#oc-preview-page) pages.

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**defaultRedirect** | used as a fallback redirection page when no specific redirect page is defined.
**create** | a configuration array or reference to a config file for the Create page.
**update** | a configuration array or reference to a config file for the Update page.
**preview** | a configuration array or reference to a config file for the Preview page.

<a id="oc-create-page"></a>
### Create Page

To support the Create page add the following configuration to the YAML file.

```yaml
create:
    title: New Blog Post
    redirect: acme/blog/posts/update/:id
    redirectClose: acme/blog/posts
```

The following configuration options are supported for the Create page.

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**title** | a page title, can refer to a [localization string](../plugin/localization.md).
**redirect** | redirection page when record is saved.
**redirectClose** | redirection page when record is saved and the **close** post variable is sent with the request.
**form** | overrides the default form fields definitions for the create page only.

<a id="oc-update-page"></a>
### Update Page

To support the Update page add the following configuration to the YAML file.

```yaml
update:
    title: Edit Blog Post
    redirect: acme/blog/posts
```

The following configuration options are supported for the Update page.

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**title** | a page title, can refer to a [localization string](../plugin/localization.md).
**redirect** | redirection page when record is saved.
**redirectClose** | redirection page when record is saved and **close** post variable is sent with the request.
**form** | overrides the default form fields definitions for the update page only.

<a id="oc-preview-page"></a>
### Preview Page

To support the Preview page add the following configuration to the YAML file:

```yaml
preview:
    title: View Blog Post
```

The following configuration options are supported for the Preview page.

Option  | Description
------------- | -------------
**title** | a page title, can refer to a [localization string](../plugin/localization.md).
**form** | overrides the default form fields definitions for the preview page only.

### Custom Messages

Specify the `customMessages` option to override the default messages used by the Form Controller. The values can be plain text or can refer to a [localization string](../plugin/localization.md).

```yaml
customMessages:
    notFound: Did not find the thing
    flashCreate: New thing created
    flashUpdate: Updated that thing
    flashDelete: Thing is gone
```

You may also modify messages in the context of the form being displayed. The following will override the `notFound` message for the `update` context only.

```yaml
update:
    customMessages:
        notFound: Nothing found when updating
```

The following messages are available to override as custom messages.

Message | Default Message
------------- | -------------
notFound | Form record with an ID of :id could not be found.
flashCreate | :name Created
flashUpdate | :name Updated
flashDelete | :name Deleted

<a id="oc-defining-form-fields"></a>
## Defining Form Fields

Form fields are defined with the YAML file. The form fields configuration is used by the form behavior for creating the form controls and binding them to the model fields. The file is placed to a subdirectory of the **models** directory of a plugin. The subdirectory name matches the model class name written in lowercase. The file name doesn't matter, but **fields.yaml** and **form_fields.yaml** are common names. Example form fields file location:

::: dir
├── plugins
|   └── acme
|       └── blog
|           └── `models`
|               ├── post            _<== Config Directory_
|               |   └── fields.yaml _<== Config File_
|               └── Post.php        _<== Model Class_
:::

Fields can be placed in three areas, the **outside area**, **primary tabs** or **secondary tabs**. The next example shows the typical contents of a form fields definition file.

```yaml
# ===================================
#  Form Field Definitions
# ===================================

fields:
    blog_title:
        label: Blog Title
        description: The title for this blog

    published_at:
        label: Published date
        description: When this blog post was published
        type: datepicker

    # [...]

tabs:
    fields:
        # [...]

secondaryTabs:
    fields:
        # [...]
```

<a id="oc-field-options"></a>
### Field Options

For each field you can specify these options (where applicable):

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**label** | a name when displaying the form field to the user.
**type** | defines how this field should be rendered (see [Available fields types](#oc-available-field-types) below). Default: text.
**span** | aligns the form field to one side. Options: auto, left, right, row, full. Default: full.
**spanClass** | used with the span `row` option to display the form as a Bootstrap grid, for example, `spanClass: col-xs-4`.
**size** | specifies a field size for fields that use it, for example, the textarea field. Options: tiny, small, large, huge, giant.
**placeholder** | if the field supports a placeholder value.
**comment** | places a descriptive comment below the field.
**commentAbove** | places a comment above the field.
**commentHtml** | allow HTML markup inside the comment. Options: true, false.
**default** | specify the default value for the field. For `dropdown`, `checkboxlist`, `radio` and `balloon-selector` widgets, you may specify an option key here to have it selected by default.
**defaultFrom** | takes the default value from the value of another field.
**tab** | assigns the field to a tab.
**cssClass** | assigns a CSS class to the field container.
**readOnly** | prevents the field from being modified. Options: true, false.
**disabled** | prevents the field from being modified and excludes it from the saved data. Options: true, false.
**hidden** | hides the field from the view and excludes it from the saved data. Options: true, false.
**stretch** | specifies if this field stretches to fit the parent height.
**context** | specifies what context should be used when displaying the field. Context can also be passed by using an `@` symbol in the field name, for example, `name@update`.
**dependsOn** | an array of other field names this field [depends on](#oc-field-dependencies), when the other fields are modified, this field will update.
**changeHandler** | the name of an AJAX handler to call when the field value is changed, optional.
**trigger** | specify conditions for this field using [trigger events](#oc-trigger-events).
**preset** | allows the field value to be initially set by the value of another field, converted using the [input preset converter](#oc-input-preset-converter).
**required** | places a red asterisk next to the field label to indicate it is required. Be sure to use [validation on the model](../database/traits.md#oc-validation) as this is not enforced by the form controller.
**attributes** | specify custom HTML attributes to add to the form field element.
**containerAttributes** | specify custom HTML attributes to add to the form field container.
**permissions** | the [permissions](users.md#oc-users-and-permissions) that the current backend user must have in order for the field to be used. Supports either a string for a single permission or an array of permissions of which only one is needed to grant access.

### Nested Field Selection

Fields from related models can be rendered with the [Relation Widget](#relation-widget) or the [Relation Manager](relations.md#oc-relationship-types). However, if the relationship type is singular, or a [jsonable array](../database/model.md#oc-supported-properties), you may use a nested field type using the **relation[field]** definition.

```yaml
avatar[name]:
    label: Avatar
    comment: will be saved in the Avatar table
```

The above example would fetch and save the value in PHP equivalent of `$record->avatar->name` or `$record->avatar['name']` respectively.

### Tab Options

For each tab definition, namely `tabs` and `secondaryTabs`, you can specify these options:

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**stretch** | specifies if this tab stretches to fit the parent height.
**defaultTab** | the default tab to assign fields to. Default: Misc.
**activeTab** | selected tab when the form first loads, name or index. Default: 1
**icons** | assign icons to tabs using tab names as the key.
**lazy** | array of tabs to be loaded dynamically when clicked. Useful for tabs that contain large amounts of content.
**linkable** | determines if the tabs can be linked using URL fragments. Default: true
**cssClass** | assigns a CSS class to the tab container.
**paneCssClass** | assigns a CSS class to an individual tab pane. Value is an array, key is tab index or label, value is the CSS class. It can also be specified as a string, in which case the value will be applied to all tabs.

```yaml
tabs:
    stretch: true
    defaultTab: User
    cssClass: text-blue
    lazy:
        - Groups
    paneCssClass:
        1: first-tab
        2: second-tab
    icons:
        User: icon-user
        Groups: icon-group

    fields:
        username:
            type: text
            label: Username
            tab: User

        groups:
            type: relation
            label: Groups
            tab: Groups
```

<a id="oc-available-field-types"></a>
## Available Field Types

There are various native field types that can be used for the **type** setting. For basic UI elements, take a look at the [available UI elements](#oc-available-ui-elements). For more advanced form fields, a [form widget](#oc-form-widgets) can be used instead.

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- [Text](#field-text)
- [Number](#field-number)
- [Password](#field-password)
- [Email](#field-email)
- [Textarea](#field-textarea)
- [Dropdown](#field-dropdown)
- [Radio List](#field-radio)
- [Balloon Selector](#field-balloon)
- [Checkbox](#field-checkbox)
- [Checkbox List](#field-checkboxlist)
- [Switch](#field-switch)
- [Widget](#field-widget)

</div>

<a name="field-text"></a>
### Text

`text` - renders a single line text box. This is the default type used if none is specified.

```yaml
blog_title:
    label: Blog Title
    type: text
```

<a name="field-number"></a>
### Number

`number` - renders a single line text box that takes numbers only.

```yaml
your_age:
    label: Your Age
    type: number
    step: 1  # defaults to 'any'
    min: 1   # defaults to not present
    max: 100 # defaults to not present
```

If you would like to validate this field server-side on save to ensure that it is numeric, please use the `$rules` property on your model, like so:

```php
/**
 * @var array Validation rules
 */
public $rules = [
    'your_age' => 'numeric',
];
```

For more information on model validation, please visit [the documentation page](https://octobercms.com/docs/services/validation#rule-numeric).

<a name="field-password"></a>
### Password

`password ` - renders a single line password field.

```yaml
user_password:
    label: Password
    type: password
```

<a name="field-email"></a>
### Email

`email` - renders a single line text box with the type of `email`, triggering an email-specialised keyboard in mobile browsers.

```yaml
user_email:
    label: Email Address
    type: email
```

If you would like to validate this field on save to ensure that it is a properly-formatted email address, please use the `$rules` property on your model, like so:

```php
/**
 * @var array Validation rules
 */
public $rules = [
    'user_email' => 'email',
];
```

For more information on model validation, please visit [the documentation page](https://octobercms.com/docs/services/validation#rule-email).

<a name="field-textarea"></a>
### Textarea

`textarea` - renders a multiline text box. A size can also be specified with possible values: tiny, small, large, huge, giant.

```yaml
blog_contents:
    label: Contents
    type: textarea
    size: large
```

<a name="field-dropdown"></a>
### Dropdown

`dropdown` - renders a dropdown with specified options. There are a number of ways to provide the dropdown options, most of them involve specify the `options` value.

Option values only, where the values and labels are the same.

```yaml
status_type:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    default: published
    options:
        draft
        published
        archived
```

Options with key-value pair, where the value and label are independently specified.

```yaml
status_type:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    default: published
    options:
        draft: Draft
        published: Published
        archived: Archived
```

The next approaches involve using the model class in your plugin or application codebase. If the `options` value is omitted, the framework expects a method with the name `get*FieldName*Options` to be defined in the model.

Using the example below, the model class is expected to have the `getStatusTypeOptions` method. The first argument of this method is the current value of this field and the second is the current data object for the entire form. This method should return an array of options in the format **key => label**.

```yaml
status_type:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
```

This is an example of the model class method that supplies the dropdown options. Notice that the method name matches the column name in _TitleCase_ format.

```php
public function getStatusTypeOptions($value, $formData)
{
    return ['all' => 'All', ...];
}
```

You may also define a catch-all method that works as a fallback in cases where the dedicated method name is not defined, which will be used for all dropdown field types for the model.

The first argument of this method is the field name, the second is the current value of the field, and the third is the current data object for the entire form. It should return an array of options in the format **key => label**.

```php
public function getDropdownOptions($fieldName, $value, $formData)
{
    if ($fieldName == 'status') {
        return ['all' => 'All', ...];
    }
    else {
        return ['' => '-- none --'];
    }
}
```

To use a custom method name, specify it explicitly in the `options` parameter and this will match exactly to the method name defined in the model.

In the next example the `listStatuses` method should be defined in the model class. This method receives all the same arguments as the `getDropdownOptions` method, and should return an array of options in the format **key => label**.

```yaml
status:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    options: listStatuses
```

This is an example of the model class custom method that supplies the dropdown options.

```php
public function listStatuses($fieldName, $value, $formData)
{
    return ['published' => 'Published', ...];
}
```

To add a custom icon for every option rendered in the dropdown field, you may specify the options as a multidimensional array with the following format **key => [label-text, label-icon]**.

```php
public function listStatuses($fieldName, $value, $formData)
{
    return [
        'published' => ['Published', 'icon-check-circle'],
        'unpublished' => ['Unpublished', 'icon-minus-circle'],
        'draft' => ['Draft', 'icon-clock-o']
    ];
}
```

Displaying a custom color is also supported by specifying the options as an array with the format **key => [label-text, label-color]** where the color is a hex value beginning with a hash (`#`).

```php
public function listStatuses($fieldName, $value, $formData)
{
    return [
        'published' => ['Published', '#666666'],
        'unpublished' => ['Unpublished', '#ff9999'],
        'draft' => ['Draft', '#ff0000']
    ];
}
```

If you want to call a method on an external class, you may do it by calling a static method on any fully qualified object. Simply specify the `ClassName::method` syntax as a string in the `options` parameter.

```yaml
status:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    options: \MyAuthor\MyPlugin\Helpers\FormHelper::staticMethodOptions
```

This examples shows the static method defined on any helper class. The first argument is the Model object and the second argument is the form field definition.

```php
public static function staticMethodOptions($model, $formField)
{
    return ['published' => 'Published', ...];
}
```

To handle cases when there is no value set on the model, you may specify an `emptyOption` value to include an empty option that can be reselected.

```yaml
status:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    emptyOption: -- no status --
```

Alternatively you may use the `placeholder` option to use a "one-way" empty option that cannot be reselected.

```yaml
status:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    placeholder: -- select a status --
```

By default the dropdown has a searching feature, allowing quick selection of a value. This can be disabled by setting the `showSearch` option to `false`.

```yaml
status:
    label: Blog Post Status
    type: dropdown
    showSearch: false
```

<a name="field-radio"></a>
### Radio List

`radio` - renders a list of radio options, where only one item can be selected at a time.

```yaml
security_level:
    label: Access Level
    type: radio
    default: guests
    options:
        all: All
        registered: Registered only
        guests: Guests only
```

Radio lists can also support a secondary description.

```yaml
security_level:
    label: Access Level
    type: radio
    options:
        all: [All, Guests and customers will be able to access this page.]
        registered: [Registered only, Only logged in member will be able to access this page.]
        guests: [Guests only, Only guest users will be able to access this page.]
```

Radio lists support the same methods for defining the options as the [dropdown field type](#field-dropdown). For radio lists the method could return either the simple array: **key => value** or an array of arrays for providing the descriptions: **key => [label, description]**. Options can be displayed inline with each other instead of in separate rows by specifying `cssClass: 'inline-options'` on the radio field config.

<a name="field-balloon"></a>
### Balloon Selector

`balloon-selector` - renders a list, where only one item can be selected at a time.

```yaml
gender:
    label: Gender
    type: balloon-selector
    default: female
    options:
        female: Female
        male: Male
```

Balloon selectors support the same methods for defining the options as the [dropdown field type](#field-dropdown).

<a name="field-checkbox"></a>
### Checkbox

`checkbox` - renders a single checkbox.

```yaml
show_content:
    label: Display content
    type: checkbox
    default: true
```

<a name="field-checkboxlist"></a>
### Checkbox List

`checkboxlist` - renders a list of checkboxes.

```yaml
permissions:
    label: Permissions
    type: checkboxlist
    options:
        open_account: Open account
        close_account: Close account
        modify_account: Modify account
```

Checkbox lists support the same methods for defining the options as the [dropdown field type](#field-dropdown) and also support secondary descriptions, found in the [radio field type](#field-radio).

```yaml
permissions:
    type: checkboxlist
    options: listPermissions
```

Options can be displayed inline with each other instead of in separate rows by specifying **inline-options** as the `cssClass` on the field config.

```yaml
permissions:
    type: checkboxlist
    cssClass: inline-options
```

A quick select menu with "Select All" and "Select None" buttons will become visible when the list has greater than 10 items. To explicitly enable these buttons, use the `quickselect` option.

```yaml
permissions:
    type: checkboxlist
    quickselect: true
```

<a name="field-switch"></a>
### Switch

`switch` - renders a switchbox.

```yaml
show_content:
    label: Display content
    type: switch
    comment: Flick this switch to display content
```

You may customize the switch text by passing an array to the `options` value with false and true labels.

```yaml
show_content:
    label: Display content
    type: switch
    options:
        - Nope
        - Yeah
```

<a name="field-widget"></a>
### Widget

`widget` - renders a custom form widget, the `type` field can refer directly to the class name of the widget or the registered alias name.

```yaml
blog_content:
    type: Backend\FormWidgets\RichEditor
    size: huge
```

<a id="oc-available-ui-elements"></a>
## Available UI Elements

There are non function UI elements that can be included in forms to help with the layout design.

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- [Section](#field-section)
- [Hint](#field-hint)
- [Horizontal Rule](#field-ruler)
- [Partial](#field-partial)

</div>

<a name="field-section"></a>
### Section

`section` - renders a section heading and subheading. The `label` and `comment` values are optional and contain the content for the heading and subheading.

```yaml
_section1:
    label: User details
    type: section
    comment: This section contains details about the user.
```

<a name="field-hint"></a>
### Hint

`hint` - identical to a `partial` field but renders inside a hint container that can be hidden by the user.

```yaml
_hint1:
    type: hint
    path: content_field
```

A hint supports content inline to the field. The `label` and `comment` values are optional and contain the content for the heading and subheading. You may also use Markdown syntax for the values.

```yaml
_tip1:
    type: hint
    mode: tip
    label: Pro Tip
    comment: Always check to make sure this field is populated.
```

The `mode` option supports the values: tip, info, warning, danger, success

```yaml
_warning1:
    type: hint
    mode: warning
    label: Always wash your hands
    comment: This is good for stopping the spread of germs.
```

<a name="field-ruler"></a>
### Horizontal Rule

`ruler` - renders a horizontal rule to break up the form contents

```yaml
_ruler1:
    type: ruler
```

<a name="field-partial"></a>
### Partial

`partial` - renders a partial, the `path` value can refer to a partial view file otherwise the field name is used as the partial name. Inside the partial these variables are available: `$value` is the default field value, `$model` is the model used for the field and `$field` is the configured class object `Backend\Classes\FormField`.

```yaml
content:
    type: partial
    path: $/acme/blog/models/comments/_content_field.htm
```

<a id="oc-form-widgets"></a>
## Form Widgets

There are various form widgets included as standard, although it is common for plugins to provide their own custom form widgets. You can read more on the [Form Widgets](widgets.md#oc-form-widgets) article.

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">

- [Code Editor](#widget-codeeditor)
- [Color Picker](#widget-colorpicker)
- [Data Table](#widget-datatable)
- [Date Picker](#widget-datepicker)
- [File Upload](#widget-fileupload)
- [Markdown Editor](#widget-markdowneditor)
- [Media Finder](#widget-mediafinder)
- [Nested Form](#widget-nestedform)
- [Record Finder](#widget-recordfinder)
- [Relation](#widget-relation)
- [Repeater](#widget-repeater)
- [Rich Editor / WYSIWYG](#widget-richeditor)
- [Sensitive](#widget-sensitive)
- [Tag List](#widget-taglist)

</div>

<a name="widget-codeeditor"></a>
### Code Editor

`codeeditor` - renders a plaintext editor for formatted code or markup. Note the options may be inherited by the code editor preferences defined for the Administrator in the back-end.

```yaml
css_content:
    type: codeeditor
    size: huge
    language: html
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**language** | code language, for example, php, css, javascript, html. Default: `php`.
**showGutter** | shows a gutter with line numbers. Default: `true`.
**wrapWords** | breaks long lines on to a new line. Default `true`.
**fontSize** | the text font size. Default: 12.

<a name="widget-colorpicker"></a>
### Color Picker

`colorpicker` - renders controls to select a hexadecimal color value.

```yaml
color:
    label: Background
    type: colorpicker
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**availableColors** |  list of available colors.
**allowEmpty** | allows empty input value. Default: false

There are two ways to provide the available colors for the colorpicker. The first method defines the `availableColors` directly as a list of hex color codes in the YAML file:

```yaml
color:
    label: Background
    type: colorpicker
    availableColors: ['#000000', '#111111', '#222222']
```

The second method uses a specific method declared in the model class.  This method should return an array of hex colors in the same format as in the example above. The first argument of this method is the field name, the second is the currect value of the field, and the third is the current data object for the entire form.

```yaml
color:
    label: Background
    type: colorpicker
    availableColors: myColorList
```

Supplying the available colors in the model class:

```php
public function myColorList($fieldName, $value, $formData)
{
    return ['#000000', '#111111', '#222222']
}
```

If the `availableColors` field in not defined in the YAML file, the colorpicker uses a set of 20 default colors.

### Data Table

`datatable` - renders an editable table of records, formatted as a grid. Cell content can be editable directly in the grid, allowing for the management of several rows and columns of information.

```yaml
data:
    type: datatable
    adding: true
    deleting: true
    columns: []
    recordsPerPage: false
    searching: false
```

> **Note**: In order to use this with a model, the field should be defined in the [jsonable property](../database/model.md#oc-supported-properties) or anything that can handle storing as an array.

#### Table configuration

The following lists the configuration values of the data table widget itself.

Option | Description
------ | -----------
**adding** | allow records to be added to the data table. Default: `true`.
**btnAddRowLabel** | defines a custom label for the "Add Row Above" button.
**btnAddRowBelowLabel** | defines a custom label for the "Add Row Below" button.
**btnDeleteRowLabel** | defines a custom label for the "Delete Row" button.
**columns** | an array representing the column configuration of the data table. See the *Column configuration* section below.
**deleting** | allow records to be deleted from the data table. Default: `false`.
**dynamicHeight** | if `true`, the data table's height will extend or shrink depending on the records added, up to the maximum size defined by the `height` configuration value. Default: `false`.
**fieldName** | defines a custom field name to use in the POST data sent from the data table. Leave blank to use the default field alias.
**height** | the data table's height, in pixels. If set to `false`, the data table will stretch to fit the field container.
**keyFrom** | the data attribute to use for keying each record. This should usually be set to `id`. Only supports integer values.
**postbackHandlerName** | specifies the AJAX handler name in which the data table content will be sent with. When set to `null` (default), the handler name will be auto-detected from the request name used by the form which contains the data table. It is recommended to keep this as `null`.
**recordsPerPage** | the number of records to show per page. If set to `false`, the pagination will be disabled.
**searching** | allow records to be searched via a search box. Default: `false`.
**toolbar** | an array representing the toolbar configuration of the data table.

#### Column configuration

The data table widget allows for the specification of columns as an array via the `columns` configuration variable. Each column should use the field name as a key, and the following configuration variables to set up the field.

Example:

```yaml
columns:
    id:
        type: string
        title: ID
        validation:
            integer:
                message: Please enter a number
    name:
        type: string
        title: Name
```

Option | Description
------ | -----------
**type** | the input type for this column's cells. Must be one of the following: `string`, `checkbox`, `dropdown` or `autocomplete`.
**options** | for `dropdown` and `autocomplete` columns only - this specifies the AJAX handler that will return the available options, as an array. The array key is used as the value of the option, and the array value is used as the option label.
**readOnly** | whether this column is read-only. Default: `false`.
**title** | defines the column's title.
**validation** | an array specifying the validation for the content of the column's cells. See the *Column validation* section below.
**width** | defines the width of the column, in pixels.

#### Column validation

Column cells can be validated against the below types of validation. Validation should be specified as an array, with the type of validation used as a key, and an optional message specified as the `message` attrbute for that validation.

Validation | Description
---------- | -----------
**float** | Validates the data as a float. An optional boolean `allowNegative` attribute can be provided, allowing for negative float numbers.
**integer** | Validates the data as an integer. An optional boolean `allowNegative` attribute can be provided, allowing for negative integers.
**length** | Validates the data to be of a certain length. An integer `min` and `max` attribute must be provided, representing the minimum and maximum number of characters that must be entered.
**regex** | Validates the data against a regular expression. A string `pattern` attribute must be provided, defining the regular expression to test the data against.
**required** | Validates that the data must be entered before saving.

<a name="widget-nestedform"></a>
### Nested Form

`nestedform` - renders a nested form using a related record or [jsonable attribute](../database/model.md#oc-supported-properties). Fields can be defined inline or using an external yaml file.

```yaml
content:
    type: nestedform

**modelClass** | class of the model to use for listing records when useRelation = false

<a name="widget-relation"></a>
### Relation

`relation` - renders either a dropdown or checkbox list according to the field relation type. Singular relationships display a dropdown, multiple relationships display a checkbox list. The label used for displaying each relation is sourced by the `nameFrom` or `select` definition.

```yaml
categories:
    label: Categories
    type: relation
    nameFrom: title
```

Alternatively, you may populate the label using a custom `select` statement. Any valid SQL statement works here.

```yaml
user:
    label: User
    type: relation
    select: concat(first_name, ' ', last_name)
```

You can also provide a model scope to use to filter the results with the `scope` property.

```yaml
user:
    label: User
    type: relation
    scope: withTrashed
```

If the controller implements the [Relation Controller behavior](../backend/relations.md#configuring-the-relation-behavior) and the field is defined there, then it will be displayed using this definition. Set the `useController` property to false to disable this functionality.

```yaml
countries:
    label: Categories
    type: relation
    useController: false
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**nameFrom** | a model attribute name used for displaying the relation label. Default: name.
**select** | a custom SQL select statement to use for the name.
**order** | an order clause to sort options by. Example: `name desc`.
**emptyOption** | text to display when there is no available selections.
**scope** | specifies a [query scope method](../database/model.md#oc-query-scopes) defined in the **related form model** to apply to the list query always.
**useController** | display the field using integration with [RelationController behavior](../backend/relations.md#configuring-the-relation-behavior). Default: `true`

<a name="widget-repeater"></a>
### Repeater

`repeater` - renders a repeating set of form fields using a related record or [jsonable attribute](../database/model.md#oc-supported-properties).

```yaml
extra_information:
    type: repeater
    titleFrom: title_when_collapsed
    form:
        fields:
            added_at:
                label: Date added
                type: datepicker
            details:
                label: Details
                type: textarea
            title_when_collapsed:
                label: This field is the title when collapsed
                type: text
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**form** | a reference to form field definition file, see [backend form fields](#oc-defining-form-fields). Inline fields can also be used.
**prompt** | text to display for the create button. Default: Add new item.

**itemsExpanded** | if repeater items should be expanded by default when using accordion mode. Default: `true`.
**titleFrom** | name of field within items to use as the title for the collapsed item.
**minItems** | minimum items required. Pre-displays those items when not using groups. For example if you set `minItems: 1` the first row will be displayed and not hidden.
**maxItems** | maximum number of items to allow within the repeater.
**groups** | references a group of form fields placing the repeater in group mode (see below). An inline definition can also be used.
**groupKeyFrom** | the group key attribute stored along with the saved data. Default: `_group`
**showReorder** | displays an interface for sorting items. Default: true
**showDuplicate** | displays an interface for cloning items. Default: true

The repeater field supports a group mode which allows a custom set of fields to be chosen for each iteration.

```yaml
content:
    type: repeater
    prompt: Add content block
    groups: $/acme/blog/config/repeater_fields.yaml
```

This is an example of a group configuration file, which would be located in **/plugins/acme/blog/config/repeater_fields.yaml**. Alternatively these definitions could be specified inline with the repeater.

```yaml
textarea:
    name: Textarea
    description: Basic text field
    icon: icon-file-text-o
    fields:
        text_area:
            label: Text Content
            type: textarea
            size: large

quote:
    name: Quote
    description: Quote item
    icon: icon-quote-right
    fields:
        quote_position:
            span: auto
            label: Quote Position
            type: radio
            options:
                left: Left
                center: Center
                right: Right
        quote_content:
            span: auto
            label: Details
            type: textarea
```

Each group must specify a unique key and the definition supports the following options.

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**name** | the name of the group.
**description** | a brief description of the group.
**icon** | defines an icon for the group, optional.
**fields** | form fields belonging to the group, see [backend form fields](#oc-defining-form-fields).

> **Note**: The group key is stored along with the saved data as the `_group` attribute. This can be customized with the `groupKeyFrom` option.

<a name="widget-richeditor"></a>
### Rich editor / WYSIWYG

`richeditor` - renders a visual editor for rich formatted text, also known as a WYSIWYG editor.

```yaml
html_content:
    type: richeditor
    toolbarButtons: bold|italic
    size: huge
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**toolbarButtons** | which buttons to show on the editor toolbar.

The available toolbar buttons are:

```
fullscreen, bold, italic, underline, strikeThrough, subscript, superscript, fontFamily, fontSize, |, color, emoticons, inlineStyle, paragraphStyle, |, paragraphFormat, align, formatOL, formatUL, outdent, indent, quote, insertHR, -, insertLink, insertImage, insertVideo, insertAudio, insertFile, insertTable, undo, redo, clearFormatting, selectAll, html

<a name="widget-sensitive"></a>
### Sensitive

`sensitive` - renders a revealable password field that can be used for sensitive information such as API keys or secrets, configuration values, etc. A sensitive field can be toggled visible and hidden at the user's request.

A sensitive field that contains a previously entered value will have the value replaced with a placeholder value on load, preventing the value from being guessed by length or copied. Upon revealing the value, the original value is retrieved by AJAX and populated into the field.

```yaml
api_secret:
    type: sensitive
    allowCopy: false
    hideOnTabChange: true
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**mode** | display mode for the widget, either textarea or text. Default: text
**allowCopy** | adds a "copy" action to the sensitive field, allowing the user to copy the password without revealing it. Default: true
**hiddenPlaceholder** | sets the placeholder text that is used to simulate a hidden, unrevealed value. You can change this to a long or short string to emulate different length values. Default: `__hidden__`
**hideOnTabChange** | if true, the sensitive field will automatically be hidden if the user navigates to a different tab, or minimizes their browser. Default: true

<a name="widget-taglist"></a>
### Tag list

`taglist` - renders a field for inputting a list of tags.

```yaml
tags:
    type: taglist
    separator: space
```

A tag list support the same methods for defining the options as the [dropdown field type](#field-dropdown).

```yaml
tags:
    type: taglist
    options:
        - Red
        - Blue
        - Orange
```

You may use the `mode` called **relation** where the field name is a [many-to-many relationship](../database/relations#oc-many-to-many). This will automatically source and assign tags via the relationship. If custom tags are supported, they will be created before assignment.

```yaml
tags:
    type: taglist
    mode: relation
```

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**mode** | controls how the value is returned, either string, array or relation. Default: string
**separator** | separate tags with the specified character, either comma or space. Default: comma
**customTags** | allows custom tags to be entered manually by the user. Default: true
**options** | specifies a method or array for predefined options. Set to true to use model `get*Field*Options` method. Optional.
**nameFrom** | if relation mode is used, a model attribute name for displaying the tag name. Default: name
**useKey** | use the key instead of value for saving and reading data. Default: false

## Form Views

For each page your form supports [Create](#oc-create-page), [Update](#oc-update-page) and [Preview](#oc-preview-page) you should provide a [view file](../backend/controllers-ajax.md) with the corresponding name - **create.htm**, **update.htm** and **preview.htm**.

The form behavior adds two methods to the controller class: `formRender` and `formRenderPreview`. These methods render the form controls configured with the YAML file described above.

### Create View

The **create.htm** view represents the Create page that allows users to create new records. A typical Create page contains breadcrumbs, the form itself, and the form buttons. The **data-request** attribute should refer to the `onSave` AJAX handler provided by the form behavior. Below is a contents of the typical create.htm form.

```php
<?= Form::open(['class'=>'layout']) ?>

    <div class="layout-row">
        <?= $this->formRender() ?>
    </div>

    <div class="form-buttons">
        <div class="loading-indicator-container">
            <button
                type="button"
                data-request="onSave"
                data-request-data="close:true"
                data-hotkey="ctrl+enter, cmd+enter"
                data-load-indicator="Creating Category..."
                class="btn btn-default">
                Create and Close
            </button>
            <span class="btn-text">
                or <a href="<?= Backend::url('acme/blog/categories') ?>">Cancel</a>
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

<?= Form::close() ?>
```

### Update View

The **update.htm** view represents the Update page that allows users to update or delete existing records. A typical Update page contains breadcrumbs, the form itself, and the form buttons. The Update page is very similar to the Create page, but usually has the Delete button. The **data-request** attribute should refer to the `onSave` AJAX handler provided by the form behavior. Below is a contents of the typical update.htm form.

```php
<?= Form::open(['class'=>'layout']) ?>

    <div class="layout-row">
        <?= $this->formRender() ?>
    </div>

    <div class="form-buttons">
        <div class="loading-indicator-container">
            <button
                type="button"
                data-request="onSave"
                data-request-data="close:true"
                data-hotkey="ctrl+enter, cmd+enter"
                data-load-indicator="Saving Category..."
                class="btn btn-default">
                Save and Close
            </button>
            <button
                type="button"
                class="oc-icon-trash-o btn-icon danger pull-right"
                data-request="onDelete"
                data-load-indicator="Deleting Category..."
                data-request-confirm="Do you really want to delete this category?">
            </button>
            <span class="btn-text">
                or <a href="<?= Backend::url('acme/blog/categories') ?>">Cancel</a>
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

<?= Form::close() ?>
```

<a id="oc-preview-view"></a>
### Preview View

The **preview.htm** view represents the Preview page that allows users to preview existing records in the read-only mode. A typical Preview page contains breadcrumbs and the form itself. Below is a contents of the typical preview.htm form.

```php
<div class="form-preview">
    <?= $this->formRenderPreview() ?>
</div>
```

## Applying Conditions to Fields

Sometimes you may want to manipulate the value or appearance of a form field under certain conditions, for example, you may want to hide an input if a checkbox is ticked. There are a few ways you can do this, either by using the trigger API or field dependencies. The input preset converter is primarily used to converting field values. These options are described in more detail below.

<a id="oc-input-preset-converter"></a>
### Input Preset Converter

The input preset converter is defined with the `preset` [form field option](#oc-field-options) and allows you to convert text entered into an element to a URL, slug or file name value in another input element.

In this example we will automatically fill out the `url` field value when a user enters text in the `title` field. If the text **Hello world** is typed in for the Title, the URL will follow suit with the converted value of **/hello-world**. This behavior will only occur when the destination field (`url`) is empty and untouched.

```yaml
title:
    label: Title

url:
    label: URL
    preset:
        field: title
        type: url
```

Alternatively, the `preset` value can also be a string that refers to the **field** only, the `type` option will then default to **slug**.

```yaml
slug:
    label: Slug
    preset: title
```

The following options are available for the `preset` option:

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**field** | defines the other field name to source the value from.
**type** | specifies the conversion type. See below for supported values.
**prefixInput** | optional, prefixes the converted value with the value found in the supplied input element using a CSS selector.

Following are the supported types:

Type | Description
------------- | -------------
**exact** | copies the exact value
**slug** | formats the copied value as a slug
**url** | same as slug but prefixed with a /
**camel** | formats the copied value with camelCase
**file** | formats the copied value as a file name with whitespace replaced with dashes

<a id="oc-trigger-events"></a>
### Trigger Events

Trigger Events are defined with the `trigger` [form field option](#oc-field-options) and is a simple browser based solution that uses JavaScript. It allows you to change elements attributes such as visibility or value, based on another elements' state. Here is a sample definition:

```yaml
is_delayed:
    label: Send later
    comment: Place a tick in this box if you want to send this message at a later time.
    type: checkbox

send_at:
    label: Send date
    type: datepicker
    cssClass: field-indent
    trigger:
        action: show
        field: is_delayed
        condition: checked
```

In the above example the `send_at` form field will only be shown if the `is_delayed` field is checked. In other words, the field will show (action) if the other form input (field) is checked (condition). The `trigger` definition specifies these options:

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**action** | defines the action applied to this field when the condition is met. Supported values: show, hide, enable, disable, empty.
**field** | defines the other field name that will trigger the action. Normally the field name refers to a field in the same level form. For example, if this field is in a [repeater widget](#widget-repeater), only fields in that same repeater widget will be checked. However, if the field name is preceded by a caret symbol `^` like: `^parent_field`, it will refer to a repeater widget or form one level higher than the field itself. Additionally, if more than one caret `^` is used, it will refer that many levels higher: `^^grand_parent_field`, `^^^grand_grand_parent_field`, etc.
**condition** | determines the condition the specified field should satisfy for the condition to be considered "true". Supported values: checked, unchecked, value[somevalue].

### Field Dependencies

Form fields can declare dependencies on other fields by defining the `dependsOn` [form field option](#oc-field-options) which provides a more robust server side solution for updating fields when their dependencies are modified. When the fields that are declared as dependencies change, the defining field will update using the AJAX framework. This provides an opportunity to interact with the field's properties using the `filterFields` methods or changing available options to be provided to the field.

```yaml
country:
    label: Country
    type: dropdown

state:
    label: State
    type: dropdown
    dependsOn: country
```

In the above example the `state` form field will refresh when the `country` field has a changed value. When this occurs, the current form data will be filled in the model so the dropdown options can use it.

```php
public function getCountryOptions()
{
    return ['au' => 'Australia', 'ca' => 'Canada'];
}

public function getStateOptions()
{
    if ($this->country == 'au') {
        return ['act' => 'Capital Territory', 'qld' => 'Queensland', ...];
    }
    elseif ($this->country == 'ca') {
        return ['bc' => 'British Columbia', 'on' => 'Ontario', ...];
    }
}
```

You can filter the form field definitions by overriding the `filterFields` method inside the Model used. This allows you to manipulate visibility and other field properties based on the model data. The method takes two arguments **$fields** will represent an object of the fields already defined by the [field configuration](#oc-defining-form-fields) and **$context** represents the active form context.

```php
public function filterFields($fields, $context = null)
{
    if ($this->source_type === 'http') {
        $fields->source_url->hidden = false;
        $fields->git_branch->hidden = true;
    }
    elseif ($this->source_type === 'git') {
        $fields->source_url->hidden = false;
        $fields->git_branch->hidden = false;
    }
    else {
        $fields->source_url->hidden = true;
        $fields->git_branch->hidden = true;
    }
}
```

The above logic will set the `hidden` flag on certain fields by checking the value of the Model attribute `source_type`. This logic will be applied when the form first loads and also when updated by a [defined field dependency](#oc-field-dependencies). For example, here is the associated form field definitions.

```yaml
source_type:
    label: Source Type
    type: dropdown
    options:
        git: Git
        http: Http
        upload: Upload

source_url:
    label: Source URL
    type: text
    dependsOn: source_type

git_branch:
    label: Git Branch
    type: text
    dependsOn: source_type
```

You may also extend other models to apply the `filterFields` logic, see the [Filtering Form Fields](#oc-filtering-form-fields) section for more details.

### Field Facades

Sometimes you may need to display a field while preventing it from being submitted. A field can be defined as a facade by adding an underscore (\_) before the name of the field. These fields are purged automatically and no longer saved to the model, such as with the following `_map` field.

```yaml
address:
    label: Title
    type: text

_map:
    label: Point your address on the map
    type: mapviewer
```

## Extending Form Behavior

Sometimes you may wish to modify the default form behavior and there are several ways you can do this.

### Extending the Form Configuration

You may extend the form configuration dynamically using the `formGetConfig` method.

```php
public function formGetConfig()
{
    $config = $this->asExtension('FormController')->formGetConfig();

    // Set the active tab dynamically
    $config->form['tabs']['activeTab'] = 'Content';

    return $config;
}
```

### Overriding Controller Action

You can use your own logic for the `create`, `update` or `preview` action method in the controller, then optionally call the Form behavior parent method.

```php
public function update($recordId, $context = null)
{
    //
    // Do any custom code here
    //

    // Call the FormController behavior update() method
    return $this->asExtension('FormController')->update($recordId, $context);
}
```

### Overriding Controller Redirect

You can specify the URL to redirect to after the model is saved by overriding the `formGetRedirectUrl` method. This method returns the location to redirect to with relative URLs being treated as backend URLs.

```php
public function formGetRedirectUrl($context = null, $model = null)
{
    return 'https://octobercms.com';
}
```

### Extending Form Model Query

The lookup query for the form [database model](../database/model.md) can be extended by overriding the `formExtendQuery` method inside the controller class. This example will ensure that soft deleted records can still be found and updated, by applying the **withTrashed** scope to the query:

```php
public function formExtendQuery($query)
{
    $query->withTrashed();
}
```

### Extending Form Fields

You can extend the fields of another controller from outside by calling the `extendFormFields` static method on the controller class. This method can take three arguments, **$form** will represent the Form widget object, **$model** represents the model used by the form and **$context** is a string containing the form context. Take this controller for example:

```php
class Categories extends \Backend\Classes\Controller
{
    public $implement = [
        \Backend\Behaviors\FormController::class
    ];

    public $formConfig = 'config_form.yaml';
}
```

Using the `extendFormFields` method you can add extra fields to any form rendered by this controller. Since this has the potential to affect all forms used by this controller, it is a good idea to check the **$model** is of the correct type. Here is an example:

```php
Categories::extendFormFields(function($form, $model, $context) {
    if (!$model instanceof MyModel) {
        return;
    }

    $form->addFields([
        'my_field' => [
            'label'   => 'My Field',
            'comment' => 'This is a custom field I have added.',
        ],
    ]);

});
```

You can also extend the form fields internally by overriding the `formExtendFields` method inside the controller class. This will only affect the form used by the `FormController` behavior.

```php
class Categories extends \Backend\Classes\Controller
{
    // ...

    public function formExtendFields($form)
    {
        $form->addFields([...]);
    }
}
```

The following methods are available on the $form object.

Method | Description
------------- | -------------
**addFields** | adds new fields to the outside area
**addTabFields** | adds new fields to the tabbed area
**addSecondaryTabFields** | adds new fields to the secondary tabbed area
**removeField** | remove a field from any areas

Each method takes an array of fields similar to the [form field configuration](#oc-defining-form-fields).

### Filtering Form Fields

As described in the [field dependencies section](#oc-field-dependencies), you may also implement form field filtering by extension by hooking in to the `form.filterFields` event.

```php
User::extend(function ($model) {
    $model->bindEvent('model.form.filterFields', function ($formWidget, $fields, $context) use ($model) {
        if ($model->source_type === 'http') {
            $fields->source_url->hidden = false;
            $fields->git_branch->hidden = true;
        }
        elseif ($model->source_type === 'git') {
            $fields->source_url->hidden = false;
            $fields->git_branch->hidden = false;
        }
        else {
            $fields->source_url->hidden = true;
            $fields->git_branch->hidden = true;
        }
    });
});
```

## Validating Form Fields

To validate the fields of your form you can make use of the [Validation](../database/traits.md#oc-validation) trait in your model.
