# Developing Themes

The theme directory could include the **theme.yaml**, **version.yaml** and **assets/images/theme-preview.png** files. These files are optional for the local development but required for themes published on the October CMS Marketplace.

## Theme Information File

The theme information file **theme.yaml** contains the theme description, the author name, URL of the author's website and some other information. The file should be placed to the theme root directory:

::: dir
├── themes
|   └── website
|       ├── pages
|       ├── layouts
|       ├── partials
|       ├── content
|       ├── assets
|       └── `theme.yaml` _<== Information File_
:::

The following fields are supported in the **theme.yaml** file:

Field | Description
------------- | -------------
**name** | specifies the theme name, required.
**author** | specifies the author name, required.
**homepage** | specifies the author website URL, required.
**description** | the theme description, required.
**previewImage** | custom preview image, path relative to the theme directory, eg: `assets/images/preview.png`, optional.
**code** | the theme code, optional. The value is used on the October CMS marketplace for initializing the theme code value.
**authorCode** | the theme author code, optional. The value is used on the October CMS marketplace for defining the theme owner.
**form** | a configuration array or reference to a form field definition file, used for [theme customization](#oc-theme-customization), optional.
**require** | an array of plugin names used for [theme dependencies](#oc-theme-dependencies), optional.

Example of the theme information file:

```yaml
name: "October CMS Demo"
description: "Demonstrates the basic concepts of the front-end theming."
author: "October CMS"
homepage: "https://octobercms.com"
code: "Demo"
authorCode: "Acme"
```

<a id="oc-version-file"></a>
## Version File

The theme version file **version.yaml** defines the current theme version and the change log. The file should be placed to the theme root directory.

::: dir
├── themes
|   └── website
|       ├── ...
|       └── theme.yaml
|       └── `version.yaml` _<== Version File_
:::

The file contains the following format.

```yaml
v1.0.1: Theme initialization
v1.0.2: Added more features
v1.0.3: Some features are removed
```

## Theme Preview Image

The theme preview image is used in the back-end theme selector. The image file **theme-preview.png** should be placed to the theme's **assets/images** directory:

::: dir
├── themes
|   └── website
|       ├── ...
|       └── assets
|           └── images
|               └── `theme-preview.png` _<== Preview Image_
:::

The image width should be at least 600px. The ideal aspect ratio is 1.5, for example 600x400px.

## Theme Dependencies

A theme can depend on plugins by defining a **require** option in the [Theme information file](#theme-information-file), the option should supply an array of plugin names that are considered requirements. A theme that depends on **Acme.Blog** and **Acme.User** can define this requirement like so:

```yaml
name: "October CMS Demo"
# [...]

require:
    - "Acme.User"
    - "Acme.Blog"
```

When the theme is installed for the first time, the system will attempt to install the required plugins at the same time. For a streamlined experience, consider [adding these plugins to the composer depedency list](../help/publishing-packages.md#declaring-dependencies) as well.

## Theme Customization

Themes can support configuration values by defining a `form` key in the theme information file. This key should contain a configuration array or reference to a form field definition file, see [form fields](../backend/forms.md#oc-defining-form-fields) for more information.

The following is an example of how to define a website name configuration field called **site_name**:

```yaml
name: My Theme
# [...]

form:
    fields:
        site_name:
            label: Site name
            comment: The website name as it should appear on the front-end
            default: My Amazing Site!
```

The value can then be accessed inside any of the Theme templates using the [global Twig variable](../markup/this-theme.md) called `this.theme`.

```twig
<h1>Welcome to {{ this.theme.site_name }}!</h1>
```

You may also define the configuration in a separate file, where the path is relative to the theme. The following definition will source the form fields from the file **config/fields.yaml** inside the theme.

```yaml
name: My Theme
# [...]

form: config/fields.yaml
```

**themes/demo/config/fields.yaml**:

```yaml
fields:
    site_name:
        label: Site name
        comment: The website name as it should appear on the front-end
        default: My Amazing Site!
```

### Using Theme Data In CSS

Sometimes you want to include a visual preference inside your theme stylesheet. You may use CSS custom properties (variables) to make these values available. In the following example, we will use a [Color Picker field type](../backend/forms.md#widget-colorpicker) to specify a custom link color.

```yaml
form:
    fields:
        # [...]

        link_color:
            label: Link color
            type: colorpicker
```

Using the above example we can define a [CMS partial](../cms/partials.md) that passes the selected value to CSS using a local stylesheet. The partial is then included in the [theme layout](../cms/layouts.md) inside the `<head>` tag.

```html
<style>
    :root {
        --my-color: {{ this.theme.link_color }};
    }
</style>
```

> **Note**: Custom property names are case sensitive so `--my-color` will be treated as a separate custom property to `--My-color`.

Now inside your stylesheet the custom property can be used anywhere by specifying the custom property name inside the `var()` function, in place of a regular property value.

```css
a {
    color: var(--my-color);
}
```

## Localization

Themes can provide backend localization keys through files placed in the **lang** subdirectory of the theme's directory. These localization keys are registered automatically only when interacting with the October backend and can be used for form labels just like [plugin localization](../plugin/localization.md)

> **Note**: Translating frontend content should be handled with the [RainLab.Translate](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-translate) plugin.

### Localization File Structure

Below is an example of the theme's language directory.

::: dir
├── themes
|   └── website
|       └── `lang` _<== Localization Directory_
|           ├── en
|           |   └── lang.php _<== Localization File_
|           └── fr
|               └── lang.php
:::

The **lang.php** file should define and return an array of any depth, for example:

```php
return [
    'options' => [
        'website_name' => 'October CMS'
    ]
];
```

You are then able to reference the keys using `theme.theme-code::lang.key`. In the above example, the full language key you would use to reference the "website_name" localization key would be `theme.acme::lang.options.website_name`.
